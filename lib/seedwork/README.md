# @ddd-framework/seedwork

> Generates a module with minimal functionality which you may change however you see fit.

Based on [[Seedwork, Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Seedwork.html)], this package will generate a module containing minimal functionality of the `@ddd-framework`. But be warned, and to quote Fowler once more:

> Of course this means that there's no way for you to get common updates to the seedwork, once you grow it you own it. This is the kind of copy and paste reuse that many people, including me, deride.
